# E-commerce Site With Fetch Api
This project represents an e-commerce web application. It features a homepage with a title, a search box, and buttons for accessing the shopping cart. There are two sections: Categories and Products. In the Categories section, category images and names are dynamically displayed based on the data fetched from an API. The Products section displays product cards created based on the product data obtained from the API. Each card includes a product image, title, category, price, and an "Add to Cart" button. <br/>

The process of adding items to the cart occurs when the "Add to Cart" button on the product cards is clicked. The added products are stored in a cart list, and the total amount is calculated. The list of items in the cart and the total amount are displayed in a modal when the cart icon is clicked. Within the modal, the quantity of each item can be increased or decreased. Additionally, each item has a "Remove" button. <br/>

The project also includes a "Load More" button to expand the product list with more items. It provides a login screen for user authentication, with an option for social media login. <br/>

This project utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Additionally, the fetch() function is used to retrieve data from an API. <br/>
